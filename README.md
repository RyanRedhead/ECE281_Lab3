Sabin's Lab 3

# Prelab
I was provided five files:
  1. Clock_Divider.vhd
  2. nexys2_sseg.vhd
  3. Nexys2_top_shell.vhd
  4. nibble_to_sseg.vhd
  5. pinout.ucf

Given these files and a very simple box of the Nexys2_top_shell, I read through the comments and came up with a schematic of my own.  

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/sabinpark/ECE281_Lab3/master/Nexys2_top_shell_schematic.PNG "Nexys2_top_shell Schematic")

As shown in the schematic, several signals such as the switch, LED, reset, and Clock_Divider have not been assigned to anything yet.
